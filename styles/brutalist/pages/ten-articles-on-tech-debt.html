        <p>When you say "tech debt" do you include quality issues?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            clumping quality issues into the nebulous bucket of
            <em>technical debt</em> is that organizations outside of software
            engineering, product management included, are free to interpret as
            they wish. It is not uncommon for people to equate technical debt
            with
            <em>"the engineers made a bunch of mistakes or bad decisions"</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Were they necessary shortcuts, even mandated by non-engineers? Do we
          need new language?
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I would strongly encourage software organizations to eliminate
            <em>technical debt</em> from their vocabulary–particularly when it
            comes to planning–in exchange for clearly articulated quality
            improvements connected to business outcomes.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Noble, idealistic concept. <em>Good luck.</em> My attempts at these
          conversations have resulted in non-technical folks getting impatient,
          eyes glazing over, and people walking away with the wrong
          understanding and dubious conclusions.

            skills—documenting systems, recovering context from code, and
            designing for future changes—make the difference between a team that
            hums along for a decade or more and a team that repeatedly mires
            itself in declarations of code bankruptcy, rewrites, and despair.

            The Holy Grail? <em>Negative</em> maintenance load growth: the kind
            of growth that makes our code <em>more</em> maintainable over time
            instead of less. The Grail requires even more of the team than a
            healthy quotidian code stewardship routine. It requires us to look
            at individual maintenance tasks, track their origins, and address
            those problems at the source. These chores, backed by empirical
            evidence, give us something concrete to discuss in meetings about
            tech debt.

            It is a vicious cycle where we build cruft on top of cruft and

          Another source noting distinction between debt and cruft. Debt is ok.
          Cruft has gotta go.

        <blockquote>

            We can improve by first recognizing things for what they truly are:
            technical debt or cruft. It is our job to highlight the differences

          <p>
            Warning signs to watch for: compounding technical debt. Increasing
            difficulty in making seemingly simple changes to code. Difficulty in
            documenting/commenting code. Difficulty in onboarding new
            developers. Dwindling numbers of people who know how particular
            areas of the codebase actually work. Bugs nobody understands.

        <p>
          Let's add more terminology: <strong>interest rate</strong>,
          <strong>total debt</strong>, and <strong>tech assets</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            What's the interest rate on your technical debt? The ongoing extra
            work you need to do, because of the debt. For example, maybe you
            have to maintain two incompatible versions of your app while you
            finish migrating. (If you're doing a gradual migration, that is;
            most big-bang migrations fail.)
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          But actually... is debt always bad? Look at the other side of the
          coin.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Tech debt is any code you have that you have to repeatedly touch as
            you work on new or existing features. In the financial world, that
            sounds like an asset, not a debt, right? The code that's reused most
            often is your best code.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This one is really philosophical, a good read. Debt is ok as long as
          the interest rate is reasonable.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            if your interest-to-income ratio is 0.3:1, that sounds about right.
            You're investing about 30% of your time into maintenance. I bet
            that's about how much homeowners spend on maintenance. Anything more
            than that is pretty sketchy.

            the longer I stick around, the more I look like an archaeologist
            rather than a programmer. I can't deliver any new functionality
            until I've investigated, understood, translated, made sense of, and
            interpreted all of the legacy code in and around the new feature.

        <p>Makes sense. Eventually new features become impossible.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Developers working in high tech debt situations chronically
            underestimate the complexity of feature requests, and miss deadlines.
            Business stakeholders get understandably frustrated when what sounds
            like a simple request winds up taking a team a month. Developers
            work long hours and still wind up looking incompetent, and everyone
            involved in the app ecosystem becomes miserable. People quit, and
            many of those that remain do so only out of fear of a job search and
            a resulting pay cut.

          The solution:
          <strong>make tech debt payments a real part of the process.</strong>

            Aggressively pursuing zero tech debt is also problematic. This is
            the pursuit of perfection at the expense of product success. Think
            of that hackathon product that was scrappy and exciting at the
            start. Six months later, it is a monument to over-engineering...

            Product or UX-related debt is incurred when shortcuts are taken in

            not fully understanding user needs.

            has messier code and less functionality would be taking on technical
            debt. Choosing to skip proper user testing to meet a launch date
            would be functional debt.

          How do we put a number on it? From McKinsey's
          <strong>Tech Debt Ratio</strong> to using Jira ticket tagging and
          tracking effort over time.

        <p>Measurement approaches include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Interest Rate Approximation:</strong> (Maintenance Hours /
            Total Development Hours) × (% Attributed to Technical Debt) × 100

          <li>
            <strong>Tracking Time Spent:</strong> Log hours specifically
            addressing technical debt

          <li>
            <strong>Code Quality Metrics:</strong> Static analysis tools,

        <p>Microservices bring their own unique debt challenges:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In a microservice architecture, technical debt can accumulate not just
            within individual services, but also in the interactions between
            services, in the deployment infrastructure, and in the overall system
            architecture.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The article discusses strategies specific to microservices: service
          boundaries, API versioning, distributed tracing, and the importance of
          service ownership.
