        <blockquote>
          <p>
            If you want a simple answer: technical debt is neither good nor bad,
            it's debt.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Fair, I guess. Dangerous in the wrong hands, though.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Technical staff, he says, often are tasked with trying to explain
            technical debt to business staff, who may not immediately see the
            implications. "The main issue seems to be that, unlike financial
            debt, technical debt is much less visible, and so people have an
            easier time ignoring it," he suggests.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Bingo. Business staff love to borrow for their goals and have
          technical staff pay it off. Then they turn around and complain about
          technical staff taking longer to deliver. Things start to spiral from
          there with expanded padding in estimates and eroding quality as burned
          out engineers stop trying.

          A good comprehensive overview including explanation, analysis, and

          Generally good stuff. I might nitpick about its
          <code>get_user_data</code> example bordering on an unproductive part
          of Uncle Bob Clean Code theory that favors over-abstraction, too much
          indirection of logic, and ultimately makes code worse. That's a topic
          for another page.

        <h2>IT'S NOT YOUR CODEBASE</h2>
        <p>
          Sean Goedecke has some interesting takes. This one is
          counterintuitive, with a healthy dose of balance. A lot of online
          advice sells ideas about "high ownership" using words like "empower"
          or "accountability" so much that I'm not sure they mean what the
          authors think they mean. This post advocates boundaries and trust. I
          don't totally buy it. However, I also feel like he's got a point.

          He presents a steelman argument about Engineers resisting managers
          incentivized for tech debt...
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Engineers should fight against this, because it's in their interest
            to not trash their own codebases, and it's in the broader company
            interest to maintain a healthier codebase long-term (even if
            individual managers disagree).
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>... then counters</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            This does sometimes happen. But it's a deeply cynical way of looking
            at your work. I've worked with managers and product managers who
            were only interested in short-term gain. But I've also worked with
            managers and product managers who genuinely wanted to do the right
            thing, and only pushed for short-term gain when there was actually a
            strong reason.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Paint me gray and call me cynical then! Perhaps I've been burned too
          many times. People play to their incentives and rules. I often see
          moral hazard and tragedy of the commons at play as bad code happens to
          good people, and then good people get blamed. Would trust and shared
          responsibility be better? Of course. Do humans reliably work like
          that? Show me more proof. The best part of the post is a reminder that
          the code and its debt ultimately belong to the company. We're just the
          help.
