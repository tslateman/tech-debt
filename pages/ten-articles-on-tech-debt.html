        <p>When you say "tech debt" do you include quality issues?</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            clumping quality issues into the nebulous bucket of
            <em>technical debt</em> is that organizations outside of software
            engineering, product management included, are free to interpret as
            they wish. It is not uncommon for people to equate technical debt
            with
            <em>"the engineers made a bunch of mistakes or bad decisions"</em>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Were they necessary shortcuts, even mandated by non-engineers? Do we
          need new language?
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            I would strongly encourage software organizations to eliminate
            <em>technical debt</em> from their vocabulary‚Äìparticularly when it
            comes to planning‚Äìin exchange for clearly articulated quality
            improvements connected to business outcomes.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Noble, idealistic concept. <em>Good luck.</em> My attempts at these
          conversations have resulted in non-technical folks getting impatient,
          eyes glazing over, and people walking away with the wrong
          understanding and dubious conclusions.

            The Holy Grail? <em>Negative</em> maintenance load growth: the kind
            of growth that makes our code <em>more</em> maintainable over time
            instead of less. The Grail requires even more of the team than a
            healthy quotidian code stewardship routine. It requires us to look
            at individual maintenance tasks, track their origins, and address
            those problems at the source. These chores, backed by empirical
            evidence, give us something concrete to discuss in meetings about
            tech debt.

          The ol' "gotta break a few eggs to make an omelette" - but you gotta
          clean up after, too!
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Building good software involves alternating cycles of expanding and
            reducing complexity. As new features are developed, disorder
            naturally accumulates in the system. When this messiness starts to
            cause problems, progress is suspended to spend time cleaning up.
            This two-step process is necessary because there is no such thing as
            platonically good engineering: it depends on your needs and the
            practical problems you encounter.
          </p>

        <p>
          Balanced take. Goes on with an example and highlighting the challenge
          of getting it right.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Even a simple user interface such as Google's search bar contains a
            massive amount of complexity under the surface that cannot be
            perfected in a single iteration. The challenge is managing this
            cycle, letting it get messy enough to make meaningful progress, but
            not letting it get so complicated that it becomes overwhelming.

          <p>
            If maintenance load outstrips maintenance limit by enough, or for

          There are so many delightful quotes from this one, it's hard to
          choose. I'll cheat and pick one that brings up the interest-to-income
          part of the metaphor while linking to a good xkcd.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In the tech world, the interest-to-income equivalent is how much
            time you spend dealing with overhead compared to building new
            revenue-generating features. Again, getting to zero overhead is
            probably not worth it. I like this

          <p>
            If you declare bankruptcy and decide to rewrite the system, it is
            critical to re-evaluate your tech debt algorithm. Don't keep using
            an algorithm tuned to a finite game and hope it's suitable for an
            infinite game. It's a good time to try the balanced algorithm, both
            avoiding tech debt through good design practices and cleaning up the
            inevitable debt through refactoring.

          This post is pretty comprehensive, albeit a little generic and boring.
          However, I've said "good engineering is boring" before, so perhaps
          this is more valuable than my gut reaction to it.

          <p>
            Maintaining a technical debt management backlog also helps to reduce
            the payoff costs. Just like financial debt increases over time,
            technical debt increases too: the more outdated, the greater costs
            will be incurred on the payoff. It's thus critical that businesses
            pay an active role in assessing the backlog and prioritizing items
            to be paid off rather than leaving technical debt to be dealt with
            by the development team on their own (they will always have other
            pressing priorities to address).

          A coordinated, organized effort to manage the ongoing problem. Nothing
          game-changing, but still useful. Giving names to the problems is
          helpful. If the devil is in the details, we must know the demon's name
          to cast it out!
